The project goal was to create a demo SPA for image viewing / rating, with the ability to register, log in.

Using bootstrap, it has navigation bar at the top and is responsive, becoming a three-line drop down menu if there is not enough space. Easy to navigate, the selected page glows a little bit whiter than the rest. The Home page displays some images and below them 3 buttons, the left one - disabled, counting the number of 'up votes' / 'down votes' (the 2 buttons on its right). The Home page and the "If I ever" drop down menu all lead to the same "/#" page, the next two are different - "Best / Worst images" have different images. The "Help" tab displays some text and is also the 404 page, if you ever get lost. The two tabs at the right side are "Sign Up" and "Login" pages, the first has some inputs and are correctly formatted (pass hidden), the security question selection only has 1 option for demo purposes. The sign up button is disabled because there is no back end. The "Login" page is similar to the "Sign up" one, having two inputs and a button, which leads to itself, just gathering the e-mail/password info.
